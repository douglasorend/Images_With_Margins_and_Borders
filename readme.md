## Introduction
This mod adds several parameters to the "img" tag: 
[quote]
**margin** - Margin around the image.  Expressed in pixels.
**margin-left** - The image's left margin.  Expressed in pixels.
**margin-right** - The image's right margin.  Expressed in pixels.
**margin-top** - The image's top margin.  Expressed in pixels.
**margin-bottom** - The image's bottom margin.  Expressed in pixels.
[/quote]
Except for **border-style**, the border parameters are optional if borders around the image is desired:
[quote]
**border-style** - **REQUIRED!** Border style.  Valid answers: **dotted**, **dashed**, **solid**, **double**, **groove**, **ridge**, **inset**, **outset**
**border-width** - Border width.  Expressed in pixels.
**border-color** - Border color.  Expressed either as **#xxx**, **#xxxxxx**, **rbg(x,x,x)**, or **{text}**
[/quote]

## Admin Settings
There are no admin settings to this mod.  To disable, you must uninstall this mod.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.10, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up, as well as SMF 2.1 Beta 1 & 2.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

SMF 2.1 Beta 2 Nightly (as of Sept 4th, 2015) has corrected the flaw reported in [REPORT: Potentially "Fatal Flaw" in SMF's bbcode parser](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=538611.0), thus the operation that calls the "fix parameter order" function is ignored for those nightlies.
