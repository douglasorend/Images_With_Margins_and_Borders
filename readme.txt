[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.10, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up, as well as SMF 2.1 Beta 1 & 2.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

SMF 2.1 Beta 2 Nightly (as of Sept 4th, 2015) has corrected the flaw reported in [url=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=538611.0]REPORT: Potentially "Fatal Flaw" in SMF's bbcode parser[/url], thus the operation that calls the "fix parameter order" function is ignored for those nightlies.
